## Notes

While building the app, I encountered a few challenges:
1. **Displaying Images**: Initially, I had trouble displaying the images correctly. I resolved this by ensuring the image paths were accurate and using `object-fit: cover` to maintain aspect ratios.
2. **Centering Buttons**: I faced issues aligning the buttons within the cards. This was fixed by using `flexbox` with `justify-content: space-between` and setting a fixed height for the cards.
